    "# Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the company can take proactive measures to retain them, thereby reducing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "The dataset contains information about customers, including:\n",
    "- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location.\n",
    "- **Usage Patterns**: Monthly charges, total usage, service usage.\n",
    "- **Contract Details**: Contract type, tenure, payment method.\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (1 for churned, 0 for not churned).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has [X] entries and [Y] columns. There are no missing values, and the data types are a mix of integers, floats, and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "### Univariate Analysis\n",
    "- **Churn Rate**: [X]% of customers churned.\n",
    "- **Monthly Charges**: The average monthly charge is $[X].\n",
    "- **Tenure**: The average tenure is [X] months.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "- **Churn by Contract Type**: Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate.\n",
    "- **Churn by Monthly Charges**: Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn rates.\n",
    "- **Churn by Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "- **Heatmap**: Visualize correlations between features.\n",
    "- **Bar Plots**: Compare churn rates across different categories (e.g., gender, contract type).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values using [method].\n",
    "- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Used `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features.\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling**: Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like `Average Monthly Spend` and `Tenure in Months`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Selection and Training\n",
    "- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.\n",
    "- **Model Training**: Trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used `GridSearchCV` to optimize model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "- **Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Accuracy: [X]%\n",
    "  - Precision: [X]%\n",
    "  - Recall: [X]%\n",
    "  - F1-Score: [X]%\n",
    "  - ROC-AUC Score: [X]%\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Identified the top features contributing to churn prediction (e.g., monthly charges, tenure).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Learning (Optional)\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: Experimented with neural networks using `tensorflow` and `keras` for churn prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The project successfully predicts customer churn with an accuracy of [X]%. The Random Forest model performed best, with a high ROC-AUC score of [X]. Key drivers of churn include monthly charges, tenure, and contract type. The company can use these insights to implement targeted retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features like customer support interactions or satisfaction scores.\n",
    "2. **Model Tuning**: Continue tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with ensemble methods.\n",
    "3. **Deployment**: Deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.\n",
    "4. **A/B Testing**: Test retention strategies on high-risk customers to measure effectiveness."
